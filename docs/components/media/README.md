# Media

>  The media object helps build complex and repetitive components where some media is positioned alongside content that doesnâ€™t wrap around said media. Plus, it does this with only two required classes thanks to flexbox.

**Usage**

```html
<b-media>
   
    <img slot="aside" alt="Media Aside" />
    
    <h2>Media Body</h2>
    <p>Some text</p>
    
    <!-- [Optional: add media children here for nesting] -->
</b-media>
```

**Nesting**

You can easily nest media objects by including another media inside parent's body.

**Vertical Align**

Aside can be vertical aligned using `vertical-align` should be either `top`, `center` or `end` default is `top`.
